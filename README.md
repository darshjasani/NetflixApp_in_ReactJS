# NetflixApp_in_ReactJS

Day 1 : This is a simple website reacted using ReactJS. I have made it to learn more about the components and how to implement it in ReactJS. 

Day 2 : I learn how to create a component inside a component and how the name of Property affects the rendering process.
Moreover, I find out about the chrome extensions "React Developer Tools" which helps distinguish between the different components and learned 
the importance of unique "key" for each componenets.

Day 3: I learned today about if else condition and how to simplify it using ternary operator. I created to different components namely Netflix and AmazonPrime and called them as per the needed. Still it's predefined and I will be working how to make it user-defined. 

Next Update Make it Responsive and Attractive.

Thank you.
