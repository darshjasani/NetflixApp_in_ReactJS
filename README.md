# NetflixApp_in_ReactJS

Day 1 : This is a simple website reacted using ReactJS. I have made it to learn more about the components and how to implement it in ReactJS. 

Day 2 : I learn how to create a component inside a component and how the name of Property affects the rendering process.
Moreover, I find out about the chrome extensions "React Developer Tools" which helps distinguish between the different components and learned 
the importance of unique "key" for each componenets.

Next Update Make it Responsive and Attractive.

Thank you.
